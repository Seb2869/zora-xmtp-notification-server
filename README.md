# example-notification-server-go

Example push notification server, written in Golang

## Project status

This repo is in Developer Preview status, and breaking changes are still possible.

Many applications will have different needs for push notifications (different delivery providers, different metadata attached to payloads, etc), and this repo is designed to be forked and customized for each application's needs.

## Prerequisites

1. Go 1.18
2. Docker and Docker Compose

## Local Setup

To start the XMTP service and database, run:

```sh
./dev/up
```

You should then be able to build the server using:

```sh
./dev/build
```

## Usage

### Running the server

The server can be run using the `./dev/run` script. Both the `worker` (which listens for new messages on the XMTP network and sends push notifications) and the `api` service (which handles HTTP/GRPC requests) are optional, but are recommended to be both enabled in local development. In a deployed environment it may be more desirable to split these services up so that you can have N instances of `api` and a single `worker`.

```sh
## Only has to be run once
./dev/up
source .env
./dev/run --worker --api
```

### Command line options

To see a full list of command line options run

```sh
./dev/run --help
```

### Generating code

If you have made a change to the files in the `proto` folder, you will need to regenerate the related Go code. You can do that with:

```sh
./dev/gen-proto
```

All required libraries should be installed as part of that process. YMMV.

### Testing the API

The API supports plain JSON and can be used via CURL

```sh
./dev/run --api
curl \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"installationId": "123", "deliveryMechanism": {"apnsDeviceToken": "foo"}}' \
    http://localhost:8080/notifications.v1.Notifications/RegisterInstallation
```

### Running the tests

Test files must be run serially right now, due to the shared database instance which is wiped after most tests.

```sh
go test -p 1 ./...
```

## Extending the server

The implementations of the `Installations` service and the `Delivery` service designed to be easily replaced. For a production application you will likely want to replace with a more robust set of tools for managing device tokens and sending notifications idempotently. To do that, you would modify `cmd/server/main.go` and replace those service interfaces with your custom implementation.

If you are using Firebase for push delivery, the only modifications needed (if any) may be to customize the payload sent to clients.

The `Subscriptions` service has simpler requirements and will be developed to the point of suitability in a production environment.

## Deployment

You will need to deploy your own instance of the Notification Server, with the appropriate credentials to send push notifications on behalf of your app.

You may choose to run both the API and Listener in a single service or as two separate services, depending on the expected load to the API server.

## Implementing a client

Once you have the server deployed, you will need to connect to it from your client application to register devices and subscriptions. There is a guide to help guide you in this process [here](./docs/notifications-client-guide.md).
